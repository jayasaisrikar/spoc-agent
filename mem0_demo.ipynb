    "# Mem0 Integration with Codebase Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement mem0 (long-term memory) with Google Gemini in your Codebase Agent project. Mem0 allows your AI assistant to remember previous conversations and provide context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- **Persistent Memory**: Conversations are stored and can be retrieved across sessions\n",
    "- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant memories based on context, not just keywords\n",
    "- **Enhanced Context**: AI responses become more personalized and contextually aware\n",
    "- **Repository-Specific Memory**: Different memory contexts for different code repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how to integrate this powerful memory system into your existing codebase analysis tool!"
